## Commands

### Core Commands

#### `depmender scan`
Analyzes your project dependencies and shows health overview.

```bash
depmender scan                    # Scan current directory

#### `depmender fix`
Automatically fixes detected issues with backup creation.

```bash
depmender fix                     # Interactive fix with prompts
depmender fix --yes              # Auto-fix without confirmation
depmender fix --path ./backend   # Fix specific project
```

### Advanced Commands

#### `depmender doctor`
Run comprehensive system health diagnostics.

```bash
depmender doctor                  # Full system health check
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Node.js environment and version compatibility
- ✅ Project structure (package.json, lockfiles, node_modules)
- ✅ Package manager health and configuration
- ✅ Dependency analysis (duplicates, large packages)
- ✅ Performance metrics (install time, disk usage)
- ✅ Security audit results
- 💡 Personalized recommendations

#### `depmender clean`
Find and remove unused dependencies to reduce bundle size.

```bash
depmender clean --dry-run         # Preview what would be removed (default)

```

**Features:**
- 🔍 Scans source code for actual imports/requires
- 🛡️ Protects essential dependencies (build tools, linters)
- 📊 Shows potential space savings
- ⚠️ Safe removal with dependency analysis

#### `depmender watch`
Monitor project files and run dependency checks automatically.

```bash
depmender watch                   # Start monitoring current directory
depmender watch --notify          # Enable desktop notifications
depmender watch --webhook URL     # Send results to webhook
depmender watch --interval 30s    # Custom scan interval
depmender watch --auto-fix        # Automatically fix issues
```

**Features:**
- 👀 Real-time file monitoring (package.json, lockfiles)
- 🔄 Automatic scans on changes
- 🔔 Desktop notifications for critical issues
- 🌐 Webhook integration for CI/CD
- 🔧 Optional auto-fixing

#### `depmender init`

- 📋 Scanning rules (max outdated days, allowed vulnerabilities)
- 🔧 Auto-fix settings (risk levels, confirmations)
- 🎨 Output formatting (colors, verbosity)
- 🔗 Integrations (Slack, GitHub)

### Utility Commands

depmender examples              # Show usage examples
```

#### `depmender troubleshooting`
Shows troubleshooting guide for common issues.

```bash
depmender troubleshooting       # Show troubleshooting guide
```

## Configuration

Create a `depmender.config.js` file to customize behavior:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Scanning rules
  rules: {
    maxOutdatedDays: 90,           // Allow packages older than 90 days
    allowedVulnerabilities: ['low'], // Ignore low severity vulnerabilities
    excludePackages: [             // Skip these packages
      '@types/*',
      'eslint-*'
    ],
    includeDev: true               // Include devDependencies in scan
  },
  
  // Auto-fix settings
  autoFix: {
    enabled: false,                // Enable automatic fixes
    confirmBeforeFix: true,        // Ask for confirmation
    backupBeforeFix: true,         // Create backup before fixing
    maxRiskLevel: 'medium'         // Only auto-fix low/medium risk
  },
  
  // Output customization
  output: {
    format: 'detailed',            // 'minimal', 'detailed', 'json'
    showSuccessMessages: true,     // Show success messages
    colors: true                   // Enable colored output
  }
};
```

## Global Options

All commands support these global options:

- `-p, --path <path>` - Project path to analyze (default: current directory)
